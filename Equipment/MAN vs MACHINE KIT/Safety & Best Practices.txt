Safety & Best Practices

    Pre-Deployment:
    • Check all components for wear or damage.
    • Verify that air supply pressure is within operational limits.
    During Operation:
    • Always monitor pressure gauges; do not exceed bag rated pressures (typically ≤118 psi).
    • Use two-person operation for inflation: one to control the valve, one to monitor the victim and load.
    • Maintain communication between team members throughout the lift.
    Post-Operation:
    • Slowly deflate bags and secure the load before removing the kit.
    • Clean and inspect all components; record any damages or maintenance needs.
