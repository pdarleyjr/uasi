Integrated Operation & Setup

    Deployment:
        Open the Pelican case; verify all components are present and in good condition.
        Connect the preset regulator to an SCBA or high-pressure air source.
        Attach color-coded 16′ hoses to the master control kit and air lifting bags.
        Use the Deadman controller to slowly inflate the bags under the load (start with the smallest bag for delicate extrications).
        Gradually lift the machine or trapped victim, monitoring pressure on the digital controller.
        If needed, use the plastic felling wedge to initiate a gap before bag insertion.

    Integration:
    • All air bags use the same high-pressure regulator and controller for synchronized lifting.
    • Hoses and fittings are color-coded for rapid connection.
    • The kit’s modular design lets you tailor the setup to the specific rescue scenario (e.g., using KPI-3 for tight gaps and KPI-12 for large load distribution).
