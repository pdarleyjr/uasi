MAN vs MACHINE KIT

The Man & Machine Kit is an integrated system designed for complex extrication and machine rescue operations. It combines multiple Paratech air lifting bags, a plastic felling wedge, a master control kit, assorted hoses, fittings, and a robust Pelican case for transport. All components work together to provide controlled, gradual lifting of heavy machinery or trapped victims.

Quick Reference Bullet Points

    Components: Multiple air lifting bags (sizes KPI-12, KPI-5, KPI-3), hoses, fittings, control kit, Pelican case
    Operation: Use deadman controller to inflate bags gradually; always monitor pressure (max 118 psi)
    Integration: Color-coded hoses and standardized fittings ensure rapid, error-free setup
    Safety: Follow “lift an inch, crib an inch” technique; use PPE and ensure two-person operation
    Maintenance: Post-use cleaning, inspection for leaks/damage, and proper storage in Pelican case
