    quickReference: `The Man & Machine Kit is an integrated system designed for complex extrication and machine rescue operations. It combines multiple Paratech air lifting bags, a plastic felling wedge, a master control kit, assorted hoses, fittings, and a robust Pelican case for transport. All components work together to provide controlled, gradual lifting of heavy machinery or trapped victims.

Quick Reference Bullet Points

    Components: Multiple air lifting bags (sizes KPI-12, KPI-5, KPI-3), hoses, fittings, control kit, Pelican case
    Operation: Use deadman controller to inflate bags gradually; always monitor pressure (max 150 psi)
    Integration: Color-coded hoses and standardized fittings ensure rapid, error-free setup
    Safety: Follow "lift an inch, crib an inch" technique; use PPE and ensure two-person operation
    Maintenance: Post-use cleaning, inspection for leaks/damage, and proper storage in Pelican case`,

    safetyPractices: `PPE Requirements:
- Safety glasses and gloves required during setup and operation
- Steel-toed boots when handling heavy components
- Hard hat when working under lifted loads

Operational Safety:
- Always work in pairs
- Follow "lift an inch, crib an inch" protocol
- Never exceed maximum pressure (150 psi)
- Keep clear of pinch points
- Monitor load stability continuously

Equipment Care:
- Inspect all components before and after use
- Clean and dry equipment before storage
- Store in provided Pelican case
- Report any damage or leaks immediately`,

        title: "Setup & Operation",
        content: `Deployment:
    Open the Pelican case; verify all components are present and in good condition.
    Connect the preset regulator to an SCBA or high-pressure air source.
    Attach color-coded 16′ hoses to the master control kit and air lifting bags.
    Use the Deadman controller to slowly inflate the bags under the load (start with the smallest bag for delicate extrications).
    Gradually lift the machine or trapped victim, monitoring pressure on the digital controller.
    If needed, use the plastic felling wedge to initiate a gap before bag insertion.

Integration:
• All air bags use the same high-pressure regulator and controller for synchronized lifting.
• Hoses and fittings are color-coded for rapid connection.
• The kit's modular design lets you tailor the setup to the specific rescue scenario (e.g., using KPI-3 for tight gaps and KPI-12 for large load distribution).`
